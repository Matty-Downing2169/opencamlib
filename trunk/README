OpenCAMLib README

1. INTRODUCTION
OpenCAMLib (ocl) is a c++ library for creating toolpaths for cnc-machines
such as mills and lathes.

The project is hosted at
http://code.google.com/p/opencamlib/

The mailing-list for general development and user-discussion is:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib

SVN commit messages go to a mailing-list:
http://groups.google.com/group/opencamlib-svn

2. BUILDING and INSTALLING (on unix/debian-like systems)
cd into the /src directory, then run
 $> cmake .
this creates a Makefile, and build with
 $> make 
this should create the ocl library as a file "ocl.so" in the /src directory
 $> sudo make install
will install the ocl.so library and camvtk.py so that any python shell will find them.

 
if you also want to build the documentation, then run
 $> make doc
and
 $> make doc-pdf
this should create the ocl manual named "ocl-manual.pdf" in the src/doc directory

This is a list of books related to computational geometry and CAM. Please add your description or comments for each book to this page!

= Computational geometry, math etc. =
 * O'Rourke: Computational Geometry in C
 * deBerg: Computational geometry, algorithms and applications
 * Farin: [http://www.farinhansford.com/books/cagd/ Curves and Surfaces for CAGD]
 * Faux & Pratt: "Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture"
 * Held, Martin, "On the Computational Geometry of Pocket Machining", Lecture Notes in Computer Science nr500 ( available as pdf through sciencedirect.com )
  * This describes the Voronoi-diagram based approach to 2D offsetting of line segments. Held has since published papers which extends these ideas to cover circular arcs. See: http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/pocket_off/pocket.html
